        <h1>Hi, I'm Jess.</h1>
            <p class="personal">Software engineering student enrolled at The Flatiron School, currently based in East Village, NYC.</p>
            <p class="personal">I graduated from Boston College in 2018 and worked at UBS Financial Services in the Private Wealth Management division for 4 years. 
                I dabbled a little bit in coding in undergrad and have felt pulled back ever since.</p>
            <p class="personal">Excited to see where this journey leads me!</p>
